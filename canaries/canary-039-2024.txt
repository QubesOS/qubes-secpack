Statements
-----------

The Qubes security team members who have digitally signed this file [1]
state the following:

1. The date of issue of this canary is June TODO, 2024.

2. There have been 102 Qubes security bulletins published so far.

3. The Qubes Master Signing Key fingerprint is:

       427F 11FD 0FAA 4B08 0123  F01C DDFA 1A3E 3687 9494

4. No warrants have ever been served to us with regard to the Qubes OS
   Project (e.g. to hand out the private signing keys or to introduce
   backdoors).

5. We plan to publish the next of these canary statements in the first
   fourteen days of September 2024. Special note should be taken if no new
   canary is published by that time or if the list of statements changes
   without plausible explanation.


Special announcements
----------------------

Beginning with Qubes OS 4.3, there will be a new release signing key
(RSK) [3] for every new major and minor Qubes OS release. [4] Until now,
our policy has been to have one RSK for every major release (e.g., a
single RSK for the entire Qubes OS 4 release series, beginning with
Qubes OS 4.0). [5] Under the new policy, in addition to creating a new
RSK for every major release (e.g., 4.0), we will also create a new RSK
for every minor release (e.g., 4.3). Patch releases (e.g., 4.0.4 and
4.3.1) will use the same RSKs as their respective major and minor
releases. (For example, 4.0.4 would use the 4.0 RSK, while 4.3.1 would
use the 4.3 RSK.)

We are including this notice as a canary special announcement since it
constitutes a change in our RSK management policy. The goal of this
change is to reduce the scope and duration for which RSKs are used,
which is a good key management practice in general. Creating a new RSK
for each new major and minor release is technically and organizationally
easy to implement, unlike, for example, a time-based scheme, which could
require rotating keys mid-release.


Disclaimers and notes
----------------------

We would like to remind you that Qubes OS has been designed under the
assumption that all relevant infrastructure is permanently compromised.
This means that we assume NO trust in any of the servers or services
which host or provide any Qubes-related data, in particular, software
updates, source code repositories, and Qubes ISO downloads.

This canary scheme is not infallible. Although signing the declaration
makes it very difficult for a third party to produce arbitrary
declarations, it does not prevent them from using force or other means,
like blackmail or compromising the signers' laptops, to coerce us to
produce false declarations.

The proof of freshness provided below serves to demonstrate that this
canary could not have been created prior to the date stated. It shows
that a series of canaries was not created in advance.

This declaration is merely a best effort and is provided without any
guarantee or warranty. It is not legally binding in any way to anybody.
None of the signers should be ever held legally responsible for any of
the statements made here.

Footnotes
----------

[1] This file should be signed in two ways: (1) via detached PGP
signatures by each of the signers, distributed together with this canary
in the qubes-secpack.git repo, and (2) via digital signatures on the
corresponding qubes-secpack.git repo tags. [2]

[2] Don't just trust the contents of this file blindly! Verify the
digital signatures! Instructions for doing so are documented here:
https://www.qubes-os.org/security/pack/

[5] As explained in the special announcement in Qubes Canary 032
(https://www.qubes-os.org/news/2022/09/14/canary-032/), the creation
of a new RSK for Qubes OS 4.2 was an exception to the RSK policy at
the time.
