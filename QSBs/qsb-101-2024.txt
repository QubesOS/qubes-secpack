                 Register File Data Sampling (XSA-452)

Changelog
----------

2024-03-12: Original QSB
2024-03-15: Add notes about INTEL-SA-00982

User action
------------

Continue to update normally [1] in order to receive the security updates
described in the "Patching" section below. No other user action is
required in response to this QSB.

Summary
--------

On 2024-03-12, the Xen Project published XSA-452, "x86: Register File
Data Sampling" [3]:

| Intel have disclosed RFDS, Register File Data Sampling, affecting some
| Atom cores.
|
| This came from internal validation work.  There is no information
| provided about how an attacker might go about inferring data from the
| register files.

For more details, see [4].

The set of microcode updates released on 2024-03-12 [5] by Intel that,
together with changes in Xen (see the patching section), addresses the
above issue also contains other fixes. Among them there's another issue
that's likely in scope for QSBs. It's related to the return prediction
of affected processors, refered to as INTEL-SA-00982/CVE-2023-38575 [6]:

| Non-transparent sharing of return predictor targets between contexts
| in some IntelÂ® Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially
| enable information disclosure via local access.

Unfortunately the available information about the second issue is very
sparse.

Impact
-------

On systems affected by RFDS, an attacker might be able to infer the
contents of data held previously in floating point, vector, and/or
integer register files on the same core, including data from a more
privileged context.

The exact impact on systems affected by INTEL-SA-00982 is not clear. An
attacker might be able to leak information from other security contexts.

Affected systems
-----------------

At present, RFDS is known to affect only certain Atom cores from Intel.
Other Intel CPUs and CPUs from other hardware vendors are not known to
be affected.

RFDS affects Atom cores between the Goldmont and Gracemont
microarchitectures. This includes Alder Lake and Raptor Lake hybrid
client systems that have a mix of Gracemont and other types of cores.

Which systems are affected by INTEL-SA-00982 is currently not clear. At
the time of writing the list [7] linked by Intel in it's advisory
doesn't actually contain information for this issue. If you have a
system that still receives microcode updates from Intel [8] and it got
an update as part of the release on 2024-03-12 [5] it might be affected
even if it is not affected by RFDS.

Patching
---------

The following packages contain security updates that address the
vulnerabilities described in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0:
  - Xen packages version 4.14.6-7
  - microcode_ctl 2.1-57.qubes1

  For Qubes 4.2, in dom0:
  - Xen packages version 4.17.3-4
  - microcode_ctl 2.1-57.qubes1

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [2] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [1]

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.
