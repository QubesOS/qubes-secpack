                  Indirect Target Selection (XSA-469)

User action
------------

Continue to update normally [1] in order to receive the security updates
described in the "Patching" section below. No other user action is
required in response to this QSB.

Summary
--------

On 2025-05-12, the Xen Project published XSA-469, "x86: Indirect
Target Selection" (CVE-2024-28956) [3]:
| Researchers at VU Amsterdam have released Training Solo, detailing
| several speculative attacks which bypass current protections.
| 
| One issue, which Intel have named Indirect Target Selection, is a bug in
| the hardware support for prediction-domain isolation.  The mitigation
| for this involves both microcode and software changes in Xen.
|

Impact
-------

On affected systems, an attacker who manages to compromise a qube may be
able to use it to infer the contents of arbitrary system memory,
including memory assigned to other qubes.

Affected systems
-----------------

Only Intel systems between Whiskey Lake (8th generation Intel Core) and
Tiger Lake (11th generation Intel Core) are affected. See Intel's
advisory [4] for the full list of the affected CPUs.

Patching
---------

The following packages contain security updates that address the
vulnerabilities described in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.2, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.17.5-7
  - microcode_ctl version 2.1.20250512

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [2] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [1]

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.
