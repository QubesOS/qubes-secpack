                     Multiple Xen vulnerabilities

Summary
========

On 2019-03-05, the Xen Security Team published the following Xen
Security Advisories (XSAs):

XSA-285 [1] "race with pass-through device hotplug":
| When adding a passed-through PCI device to a domain after it was
| already started, IOMMU page tables may need constructing on the fly.
| For PV guests the decision whether a page ought to have a mapping is
| based on whether the page is writable, to prevent IOMMU access to
| things like page tables.  Writablility of a page may, however, change
| at any time. Failure of the relevant code to respect this possible
| race may lead to IOMMU mappings of, in particular, page tables,
| allowing the guest to alter such page tables without Xen auditing the
| changes.
| 
| Malicious PV guests can escalate their privilege to that of the
| hypervisor.

XSA-287 [2] "x86: steal_page violates page_struct access discipline":
| Xen's reference counting rules were designed to allow pages to change
| owner and state without requiring a global lock.  Each page has a page
| structure, and a very specific set of access disciplines must be
| observed to ensure that pages are freed properly, and that no writable
| mappings exist for PV pagetable pages.
| 
| Unfortunately, when the XENMEM_exchange hypercall was introduced,
| these access disciplines were violated, opening up several potential
| race conditions.
| 
| A single PV guest can leak arbitrary amounts of memory, leading to a
| denial of service.
| 
| A cooperating pair of PV and HVM/PVH guests can get a writable
| pagetable entry, leading to information disclosure or privilege
| escalation.
| 
| Privilege escalation attacks using only a single PV guest or a pair of
| PV guests have not been ruled out.
| 
| Note that both of these attacks require very precise timing, which may
| be difficult to exploit in practice.

XSA-288 [3] "x86: Inconsistent PV IOMMU discipline":
| In order for a PV domain to set up DMA from a passed-through device to
| one of its pages, the page must be mapped in the IOMMU.  On the other
| hand, before a PV page may be used as a "special" page type (such as a
| pagetable or descriptor table), it _must not_ be writable in the IOMMU
| (otherwise a malicious guest could DMA arbitrary page tables into the
| memory, bypassing Xen's safety checks); and Xen's current rule is to
| have such pages not in the IOMMU at all.
| 
| Until now, in order to accomplish this, the code has borrowed HVM
| domain's "physmap" concept: When a page is assigned to a guest,
| guess_physmap_add_entry() is called, which for PV guests, will create
| a writable IOMMU mapping; and when a page is removed,
| guest_physmap_remove_entry() is called, which will remove the mapping.
| 
| Additionally, when a page gains the PGT_writable page type, the page
| will be added into the IOMMU; and when the page changes away from a
| PGT_writable type, the page will be removed from the IOMMU.
| 
| Unfortunately, borrowing the "physmap" concept from HVM domains is
| problematic.  HVM domains have a lock on their p2m tables, ensuring
| synchronization between modifications to the p2m; and all hypercall
| parameters must first be translated through the p2m before being used.
| Trying to mix this locked-and-gated approach with PV's lock-free
| approach leads to several races and inconsistencies.
| 
| An untrusted PV domain with access to a physical device can DMA into
| its own pagetables, leading to privilege escalation.

XSA-292 [4] "x86: insufficient TLB flushing when using PCID"
| Use of Process Context Identifiers (PCID) was introduced into Xen in
| order to improve performance after XSA-254 (and in particular its
| Meltdown sub-issue).  This enablement implied changes to the TLB
| flushing logic.  The particular case of context switch to a vCPU of a
| PCID-enabled guest left open a time window between the full TLB flush,
| and the actual address space switch, during which additional TLB
| entries (from the address space about to be switched away from) can be
| accumulated, which will not subsequently be purged.
| 
| Malicious PV guests may be able to cause a host crash (Denial of
| Service) or to gain access to data pertaining to other guests.
| Privilege escalation opportunities cannot be ruled out.
| 
| Additionally, vulnerable configurations are likely to be unstable even
| in the absence of an attack.


Impact on Qubes OS
===================

XSA-285 and XSA-288 do not affect Qubes OS 4.0 in its default
configuration, since they require a PV domain with a PCI device.
Moreover, in order to take advantage of XSA-285, the user would have to
assign a PCI device to a PV domain while it was running. Such an
operation is disabled in the Qubes GUI tools and discouraged in the
Qubes documentation. [5]

XSA-287 and XSA-292 affect only PV domains, which are used only for
stubdomains in the default Qubes OS 4.0 configuration. This means that
an attacker would first have to compromise a stubdomain in order to
attack Xen by exploiting these vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, since it
is possible to manually create PV domains in Qubes OS 4.0, we consider
XSA-287 and XSA-292 to affect Qubes OS 4.0.

All four of these XSAs affect Qubes OS 3.2.

Patching
=========

The specific packages that resolve the problems discussed in this
bulletin are as follows:

  For Qubes OS 4.0:
  - Xen packages version 4.8.5-3

  For Qubes OS 3.2:
  - Xen packages version 4.6.6-46

The packages are to be installed in dom0 via the Qubes VM Manager or via
the qubes-dom0-update command as follows:

  For updates from the stable repository (not immediately available):
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update

  For updates from the security-testing repository:
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-dom0-security-testing

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.
