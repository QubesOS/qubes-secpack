         Xen hypervisor issue related to grant tables (XSA-236)

Summary
========

The Xen Security Team released Xen Security Advisories XSA-236 related
to the grant tables mechanism used to share memory between domains.
The practical impact of this advisory is believed to be denial of
service.

Technical details
==================

Xen Security Advisory 236 [1]:

| Grant copying code made an implication that any grant pin would be
| accompanied by a suitable page reference.  Other portions of code,
| however, did not match up with that assumption.  When such a grant
| copy operation is being done on a grant of a dying domain, the
| assumption turns out wrong.
|
| A malicious guest administrator can cause hypervisor memory
| corruption, most likely resulting in host crash and a Denial of
| Service.  Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled
| out.


Compromise Recovery
====================

Starting with Qubes 3.2, we offer Paranoid Backup Restore Mode, which was
designed specifically to aid in the recovery of a (potentially) compromised
Qubes OS system. Thus, if you believe your system might have been compromised
(perhaps because of the bugs discussed in this bulletin), then you should read
and follow the procedure described here:

https://www.qubes-os.org/news/2017/04/26/qubes-compromise-recovery/

Patching
=========

The specific packages that resolve the problems discussed in this
bulletin are as follows:

  For Qubes 3.2:
  - Xen packages, version 4.6.6-34

  For Qubes 4.0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.8.2-9

The packages are to be installed in dom0 via the Qubes VM Manager or via
the qubes-dom0-update command as follows:

  For updates from the stable repository (not immediately available):
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update

  For updates from the security-testing repository:
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-dom0-security-testing

A system restart will be required afterwards.

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.
