                Transitive Scheduler Attacks (XSA-471)


User action
------------

Continue to update normally [1] in order to receive the security updates
described in the "Patching" section below. No other user action is
required in response to this QSB.

Summary
--------

On 2025-07-08, the Xen Project published XSA-471, "x86: Transitive
Scheduler Attacks" (CVE-2024-36350, CVE-2024-36357) [3]:
| Researchers from Microsoft and ETH Zurich have discovered several new
| speculative sidechannel attacks which bypass current protections.  They
| are detailed in a paper titled "Enter, Exit, Page Fault, Leak: Testing
| Isolation Boundaries for Microarchitectural Leaks".
|
| Two issues, which AMD have named Transitive Scheduler Attacks, utilise
| timing information from instruction execution.  These are:
|
|   * CVE-2024-36350: TSA-SQ (TSA in the Store Queues)
|   * CVE-2024-36357: TSA-L1 (TSA in the L1 data cache)

For more information, see also [4], [5] and [6].

Impact
-------

On affected systems, an attacker who manages to compromise a qube may be
able to use it to infer the contents of arbitrary system memory,
including memory assigned to other qubes.

(As noted in Xen's advisory the other speculative attacks dicussed in
the publications are not belived to be relevant in our use case.)

Affected systems
-----------------

Only AMD CPUs with Zen 3 or Zen 4 cores are belived to be affected
(CPUID Family 0x19). For a more detailed list see [5].

Patching
---------

The following packages contain security updates that address the
vulnerabilities described in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.2, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.17.5-10
  - amd-ucode-firmware version 20250708-1

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [2] Once available, the packages should be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [1]

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new Xen
binaries.
