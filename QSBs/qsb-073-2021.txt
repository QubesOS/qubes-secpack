         Race condition when setting override-redirect flag


User action required
---------------------

Users must install the following specific packages in order to address
the issues discussed in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.0, in dom0:
  - qubes-gui-dom0 version 4.0.17

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0 and the template(s) of any GUI qube(s) [1]:
  - qubes-gui-daemon version 4.1.18

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [2] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [3]

The user session must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to
take effect, e.g., by logging out then logging back in.


Summary
--------

An override-redirect flag in the X11 protocol tells the window manager
not to manage a particular window. Windows with such flags do not get
their frames or title bars from the window manger, nor does the window
manager determine their positions. This feature is used for application
menus, tooltips, and similar accessory windows.

Unfortunately, some window managers are getting confused if the
override-redirect flag is set shortly before making the window
visible. If that happens, window manager may try to move or resize the
window without respecting size/position constrains enforced by the GUI
daemon. Normally, every window more or resize of a VM window
requested by the VM is validated by the GUI daemon. But if the action
is initiated by the window manager, it doesn't need to pass through
GUI daemon's validation.


Impact
-------

A malicious application may try to hide its unspoofable colored frame
off screen. Hiding all four sides is prevented by another constrain
(forbidding a override-redirect window covering more than 90% of the
screen), but hiding some sides is possible.

The issue affects at least XFCE and KDE. Other environments may be
affected too.


Discussion
-----------

This is yet another corner case in handling override-redirect flag. In
the long term we will try to eliminate using this flag completely. As
an immediate fix, we are adding additional validation of constrains
placed on windows override-redirect flag. This validation is done
whenever a window is moved or resized - regardless of who initiated
the action. If incorrect size or position is detected, the GUI daemon
will try to move or resize window back to the allowed size. While it a
reactive solution (a window may be in incorrect place for a very short
time), it will cover several more cases - including some other
applications resizing the window behind GUI daemon's back (this QSB).
But also, it adds additional safety check in case GUI daemon itself
missed some case.

Notes
------

[1] In Qubes 4.1, certain GUI functions historically served by dom0 can
    be delegated to separate template-based "GUI qubes." A single Qubes
    4.1 system can have multiple GUI qubes.
