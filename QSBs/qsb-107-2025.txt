            Multiple CPU branch prediction vulnerabilities

User action
------------

Continue to update normally [1] in order to receive the security updates
described in the "Patching" section below. No other user action is
required in response to this QSB.

Summary
--------

Multiple organizations have recently reported vulnerabilities that
affect CPU branch prediction behavior. Common among these
vulnerabilities is their ability to allow an attacker to manipulate the
branch prediction of the CPU to mount a speculative execution attack
(like the original Spectre v2 attack) even with existing mitigations
enabled.

On 2025-05-12, researchers from the Systems and Network Security Group
at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VUSec) published "Training Solo," [3]
which includes the following:

 - Indirect Target Selection (ITS; CVE-2024-28956, XSA-469 [6], part of
   INTEL-SA-01153 [8])

 - Lion Cove BPU issue (CVE-2025-24495, part of INTEL-SA-01322 [9])

 - IP-based attacks

 - History-based attacks

On 2025-05-13, researchers from the computer security group at ETH
Zürich (COMSEC) published "Branch Privilege Injection: Exploiting Branch
Predictor Race Conditions" [5] (BPRC; CVE-2024-45332, XSN-3 [7], part of
INTEL-SA-01247 [10])

In addition to the coordinated disclosures above, Intel also reported
internally discovering the following:

 - CVE-2025-20623 (part of INTEL-SA-01247 [10])

 - CVE-2024-43420 (part of INTEL-SA-01247 [10])

See the linked publications for further details.

Impact
-------

IP-based attacks are believed to be sufficiently mitigated by the
mitigations against ITS. [4]

History-based attacks are believed not to affect Xen. [6]

For all other vulnerabilities mentioned, on affected systems, an
attacker who manages to compromise a qube may be able to use it to infer
the contents of arbitrary system memory, including memory assigned to
other qubes.

Affected systems
-----------------

Only systems with Intel CPUs are believed to be affected. According to
Intel's descriptions:

 - ITS affects Intel CPUs from Whiskey Lake (8th Generation Intel Core)
   to Tiger Lake (11th Generation Intel Core). [8]

 - The Lion Cove BPU issue affects Intel Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake (Core
   Ultra Series 2) models. [9]

 - BPRC affects most Intel CPUs since 8th Generation Intel Core (but see
   the caveat below). [10]

 - CVE-2025-20623 affects some 10th Generation Intel Core CPUs. [10]

 - CVE-2024-43420 affects some Intel Atom CPUs. [10]

See the linked Intel security advisories for more complete and detailed
lists of affected CPU models.

Note: The information above is based on Intel's security advisories. In
general, Intel assesses whether a vulnerability affects a given CPU
model only if that model still receives microcode updates. Therefore, if
a given CPU model no longer receives microcode updates, one should not
infer that a vulnerability does not affect that model merely because
Intel does not report it as affected. In particular, COMSEC observed
that BPRC affects CPUs as far back as 7th Generation Intel Core. [5]

To determine whether your CPU still receives microcode updates, see
"Changes in Customer Support and Servicing Updates for Select Intel
Processors," [11] or check your model's official Intel product page for
an "End of Servicing Updates" (ESU) date. Note that only models that
have reached or will soon reach their ESU date have an ESU date listed.
Newer models that are still fully supported typically have no ESU date
listed.

Patching
---------

The following packages contain security updates that, when applied to
systems with Intel CPUs that still receive microcode updates, will
address the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.2, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.17.5-7
  - microcode_ctl version 2.1.20250512

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [2] Once available, the packages should be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [1]

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new Xen
binaries.
