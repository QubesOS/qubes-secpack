			     May 12, 2011


So, finally, 13 months after the first public release, we're publishing
our first security bulletin for Qubes. This is for two critical problems
we have found recently that affect Qubes: one is a problem with Intel
VT-d technology, the other one, even more critical, is a bug in our GUI
virtualization daemon. Users of Qubes Beta 1 are encouraged to update
immediately.

The update instructions are described here:

http://wiki.qubes-os.org/trac/wiki/SoftwareUpdateDom0

Below we describe the bugs and problems that are being patched in more
detail.

Critical bug in Qubes GUI daemon (QUBES-SEC-01)
================================================

Overview
---------

A critical bug in our GUI daemon might allow an attacker who already
controls one of the Qubes domains (VMs) to exploit the GUI daemon
process running in Dom0 and gain full control over the system.

The attacker would need to first compromise one of the domains, e.g. by
exploiting a buffer overflow in a Web browser running in the domain.

The bug has been introduced on April 1st by a new developer who was
implementing tray icons virtualization for Beta 1:

http://git.qubes-os.org/?p=mainstream/gui.git;a=commit;h=35647b9eb54c689e81aa5b9bdd4ab60fc1de41d2

All Beta 1 installations are affected.

Non-vulnerable GUI packages
----------------------------

We have fixed the above problem in qubes-gui-dom0 version 1.2.11. Ensure
you have this, or newer, package installed in Dom0.


Exploitation Feasibility Analysis by Rafal Wojtczuk
----------------------------------------------------

The buggy code allocates a buffer on the heap and then fills this buffer
with data whose size is controllable by a VM (determined by the contents
of a window update message) and not bound by the buffer size. Thus, an
attacker controlling the VM can send a malformed window update message
with arbitrarily large dimensions, which in turn will cause a heap
buffer overflow in the qubes_guid process running in Dom0.

It is considered to be difficult to write a working exploit for
this vulnerability, due to the following facts:

1) The attacker has only one chance to conduct the attack against the
qubes_guid process. The qubes_guid process crashes in case of a failed
attempt, and cannot be attacked again.

One theoretical way to get around this problem is to spawn a disposable
VM, take control over it and attack the disposable VM's qubes_guid
process instead. Creation of a disposable VM takes time of the order of
seconds, however, and so this kind of a brute force attack would be very
slow and ineffective.

2) The attacker is not able to write beyond the buffer with arbitrary
pattern, but instead can only _set_ single bits (but not clear any bit).

3) The heap buffer overflow does not provide immediate shellcode
execution, as all data areas in qubes_guid process are not executable.
Thus, the attacker would need to conduct a return oriented attack, which
requires control over the stack. The stack and libraries' bases are,
however, randomized, which makes this task difficult. Additionally,
because of the qubes_guid executable's small size, it may be difficult
to find all the required code pieces for a return oriented attack.

4) Due to qubes_guid's limited interaction with the attacker, the latter
has very limited control over the heap contents, so the
exploitation is much more difficult in comparison with e.g. exploiting a
buffer overflow in a web browser.

Regardless of the above mitigating factors, this vulnerability is still
considered to be critical.


Improving the Qubes Security Process
-------------------------------------

After this incident we have decided to take some additional steps in
order to minimize the likelihood of similar bugs in the future.

First, we decided to clearly mark all the VM-controlled variables with
the "untrusted_" prefix in all the Qubes security-critical code (see
below), as well as adding more extra checks and comments to the code.
This is all in the hope that developers who might be touching this code
in the future should be now much more alert and careful when processing
the untrusted input, and also it should be much easier for others to
spot an offensive commit this way.

Additionally we decided to recompile qubes_guid and qrexec_daemon with
-pie/-fPIE options to allow for better ASLR protection. Just in case ;)

Finally, we have carefully reviewed all _our_ security-critical code in
Qubes, that is:
* qubes_guid and pacat-simple-vchan
* qrexec_daemon
* qfile-unpacker (this one runs in a VM, but is security critical
because it handles file transfers from other domains)

I would like to make it clear, however, that at this moment (Qubes Beta
stage) we are _not_ putting any effort into auditing the Xen hypervisor,
and the Xen Dom0 backends we use: the storage backend (blkback) and the
xenstore (xenstored). This is because we still haven't decided on a
specific version of Xen and Dom0 kernel to use for the final Qubes 1.0,
and we're still experimenting with a few options.


VT-d escape attacks on non-IR hardware (CVE-2011-1898)
=======================================================

Problem description
--------------------

Intel VT-d technology does not protect against certain class of software
attacks coming from driver domains if the processor/chipset doesn't
support Interrupt Remapping. Currently the only client systems that
support Interupt Remapping are believed to be the very latest Sandy
Bridge-based systems, released a few months ago. All previous client
VT-d systems are believed to be vulnerable.

We discuss this class of attacks in our upcoming paper, "Following the
White Rabbit: Software Attacks against Intel VT-d technology", that
will be released soon.

This attack is only of concern to users who already rely on VT-d to
isolate their driver domains. Users that don't use Intel VT-d on their
systems are vulnerable to much simpler DMA-based attacks anyway.

An attacker would need to first compromise one of the driver domains in
the system, such as the default network domain (NetVM), in order to
trigger this attack.

On most other client systems the attacker who compromised the networking
stack or drivers would automatically gain full control over the system,
so wouldn't need to bother to use such an attack. On Qubes, however,
such an attack is needed to compromise the system, because the
networking code itself is outside of the TCB.


Exploitation feasibility
-------------------------

We have managed to demonstrated a reliable code execution in the
hypervisor context on Xen.


Patching approach
------------------

While the attack exploits a hardware problem, it seems reasonably
efficient software patches could be applied to the hypervisor in order
to mitigate known exploitation patterns, at least those that we have
discussed in our paper. Such patches for the Xen hypervisor have been
prepared and current updates for Qubes xen package brings them in.

The patches have been introduced into xen 3.4.3-9 packages. Ensure you
have those, or newer, packages installed in Dom0. There is no need to
update xen-libs and xen-devel packages in VMs.
