     Two Xen issues affecting PV (stub-)domains (XSA-428, XSA-429)


User action required
---------------------

Users must install the following specific packages in order to address
the issues discussed in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.14.5-20

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [1] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [2]

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.


Summary
--------

The following security advisories were published on 2023-03-21:

XSA-428 [3] "x86/HVM pinned cache attributes mis-handling":

| To allow cachability control for HVM guests with passed through devices,
| an interface exists to explicitly override defaults which would
| otherwise be put in place.  While not exposed to the affected guests
| themselves, the interface specifically exists for domains controlling
| such guests.  This interface may therefore be used by not fully
| privileged entities, e.g. qemu running deprivileged in Dom0 or qemu
| running in a so called stub-domain.  With this exposure it is an issue
| that
|  - the number of the such controlled regions was unbounded
|    (CVE-2022-42333),
|  - installation and removal of such regions was not properly serialized
|    (CVE-2022-42334).

XSA-429 [4] "x86: speculative vulnerability in 32bit SYSCALL path":

| Due to an oversight in the very original Spectre/Meltdown security work
| (XSA-254), one entrypath performs its speculation-safety actions too
| late.
| 
| In some configurations, there is an unprotected RET instruction which
| can be attacked with a variety of speculative attacks.


Impact
-------

The first issue (XSA-428) allows a malicious stub-domain (a VM
accompanying a HVM qube, where qemu is isolated) to potentially
crash the hypervisor (so, the whole system). Privilege escalation and
information leaks cannot be ruled out.

The second issue (XSA-429) allows a malicious PV domain to infer the
contents of arbitrary host memory, including memory assigned to other
guests. The issue affects only AMD processors supporting SMAP/SMEP -
which is believed to be some Family 0x16 models, and all later CPUs.
Systems running Intel processors are not affected by this issue.

Both issues, in default Qubes OS configuration apply only to
stub-domains controlling HVM qubes (like sys-net or sys-usb). This
means, the attacker first need to chain those issues with another
issue to break into such stub-domain.
While discouraged, user can create PV qube, which would be affected by
the second issue (on affected hardware).
