Problem description
--------------------

Today Xen.org has announced a critical bug in the Xen hypervisor [1],
that allows for PV DomU->hypervisor escalation. The bug has been found,
as usual, by Rafal Wojtczuk, Qubes co-author, and is a beautiful
demonstration of incorrect design decisions made by Intel, specifically
in the behavior of the SYSRET instruction (AMD processors are not
vulnerable).

So, while the bug has been patched in software by adding some extra
checks to the hypervisor (Xen.org just released a patch), one should
still consider it a CPU-level bug. The issue also affects other systems,
not just Xen (more details in the original advisory). Congrats to Rafal
for coming unprecedentedly close to "The Holly Grail" of system-level
exploitation!

Patching
----------

We have uploaded the patched Xen packages and users of current Qubes
Beta 3 should upgrade immediately, by running (in Dom0 console):

sudo qubes-dom0-updates

... which should bring Xen v4.1.2-4 packages that are immune to the
attack. Please reboot your systems afterwards.
