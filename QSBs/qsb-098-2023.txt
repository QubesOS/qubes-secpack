    CPU microcode updates not loaded with Dom0 kernel version 6.6.x

User action
------------

Continue to update normally [1] in order to receive the security updates
described in the "Patching" section below. No other user action is
required in response to this QSB.

Summary
--------

The Linux kernel version 6.6.0 removed the previosuly separate options for
loading Intel and AMD microcode (CONFIG_MICROCODE_INTEL and
CONFIG_MICROCODE_AMD). Only the generic CONFIG_MICROCODE option remains.
Dracut, the tool used for generating initramfs' in dom0, includes microcode
updates only when it detects support in the Linux kernel and checks that by
checking for the presence of CONFIG_MICROCODE_INTEL or CONFIG_MICROCODE_AMD in
the config of the used kernel. Since the vendor-specific options were removed
from Linux, dracut concluded microcode loading is not supported and did not
include them in the generated initramfs. The fix makes dracut check for
CONFIG_MICROCODE instead, as done in the yet unreleased upstream dracut
version.

Impact
-------

Affected systems may be vulnerable to some speculative attacks - see
earlier Qubes Security Bulletins for details.

Affected systems
-----------------

Only systems running kernel-latest version 6.6.0 or newer in dom0 are
affected. Only systems needing microcode updates loaded by the
operating system are affected - systems having up to date microcode
version loaded by the firmware are not affected.

Patching
---------

The following packages contain security updates that address the
vulnerabilities described in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0:
  - dracut-050-62.git20200529

  For Qubes 4.2, in dom0:
  - dracut-059-4

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [2] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [1]

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
initramfs binaries.
