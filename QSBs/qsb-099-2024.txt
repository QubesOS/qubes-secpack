        Qrexec policy leak via policy.RegisterArgument service

User action
------------

Continue to update normally [1] in order to receive the security updates
described in the "Patching" section below. No other user action is
required in response to this QSB.

Summary
--------

The policy.RegisterArgument service prints the whole qrexec policy due
to a leftover debug messages.

Impact
-------

A qube that is given permission to call the policy.RegisterArgument
service, can learn the whole qrexec policy. The default qrexec policy
does not contain any secrets, but user may customize it to include
qube names, tag names, custom service names and service arguments
(like key handles for U2F/CTAP proxy).

Affected systems
-----------------

In default configuration configuration no qube is allowed to use the
policy.RegisterArgument service, but the U2F/CTAP proxy encourages
allowing it for sys-usb. The Qubes Global Config graphical tool in
Qubes OS 4.2 has a checkbox for it ("Enable registering new keys with
the U2F Proxy service").

Only Qubes OS 4.2 is affected, Qubes OS 4.1 is not affected.

Patching
---------

The following packages contain security updates that address the
vulnerabilities described in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.2, in dom0:
  - qubes-core-qrexec-dom0 version 4.2.17

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [2] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [1]
