     Two Xen issues affecting PV (stub-)domains (XSA-428, XSA-429)

User action required
---------------------

Users must install the following specific packages in order to address
the issues discussed in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.14.5-20

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [1] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [2]

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.

Summary
--------

The following security advisories were published on 2023-03-21:

XSA-428 [3] "x86/HVM pinned cache attributes mis-handling":

| To allow cachability control for HVM guests with passed through
| devices, an interface exists to explicitly override defaults which
| would otherwise be put in place.  While not exposed to the affected
| guests themselves, the interface specifically exists for domains
| controlling such guests.  This interface may therefore be used by not
| fully privileged entities, e.g. qemu running deprivileged in Dom0 or
| qemu running in a so called stub-domain.  With this exposure it is an
| issue that
|  - the number of the such controlled regions was unbounded
|    (CVE-2022-42333),
|  - installation and removal of such regions was not properly
|    serialized (CVE-2022-42334).

XSA-429 [4] "x86: speculative vulnerability in 32bit SYSCALL path":

| Due to an oversight in the very original Spectre/Meltdown security
| work (XSA-254), one entrypath performs its speculation-safety actions
| too late.
| 
| In some configurations, there is an unprotected RET instruction which
| can be attacked with a variety of speculative attacks.

Impact
-------

XSA-428 could allow a malicious stub-domain to crash the hypervisor (and
hence the entire system). A stub-domain is a qube that accompanies a
"fully-virtualized" (HVM) qube and in which qemu is isolated. Privilege
escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out.

XSA-429 allows a malicious paravirtualized (PV) qube to infer the
contents of arbitrary host memory, including memory assigned to other
qubes. XSA-429 affects only AMD processors that support Supervisor Mode
Execution Prevention (SMEP) or Supervisor Mode Access Prevention (SMAP),
which likely includes certain family 0x16 models and all later models.
XSA-429 does not affect Intel processors.

Discussion
-----------

In the default Qubes OS configuration, the vulnerabilities reported in
XSA-428 and XSA-429 apply only to stub-domains that control HVM qubes
(e.g., sys-net and sys-usb). However, these vulnerabilities do not make
such stub-domains *themselves* vulnerable. Rather, these vulnerabilities
allow attacks to be launched *from* such stub-domains. Therefore, in
order to exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would have to chain
multiple independent vulnerabilities together by first compromising a
suitable stub-domain by some independent means.

For a variety of security reasons (including past PV vulnerabilities,
Meltdown, and Spectre), we abandoned PV in favor of a combination of PVH
and HVM in the default Qubes OS configuration beginning with Qubes 4.0.
[5] While advanced users still have the ability to create PV qubes
manually, this practice is discouraged. Nonetheless, if any PV qubes
exist on affected hardware, they are affected by XSA-429.
