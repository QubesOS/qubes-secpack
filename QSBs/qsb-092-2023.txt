        Linux: buffer overrun in netback due to unusual packet

User action required
---------------------

Users must install the following specific packages in order to address
the issues discussed in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0:
  - Linux kernel packages (kernel*-qubes-vm), versions 6.1.43, 6.4.8,
    5.15.124

  For Qubes 4.2, in dom0:
  - Linux kernel packages (kernel*-qubes-vm), versions 6.1.43, 6.4.8

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [1] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [2]

Network-providing qubes (like sys-net, sys-firewall) must be restarted
afterward in order for the updates to take effect.

If some network-providing qube is using in-qube kernel[3] (in default
configuration this is not the case), the shipping the fix is up to the
relevant distribution - when it will become available, installing
updates in that qube (or its template) should be sufficient. Qubes
Security Team has no control over timeline of this process, for the
time being you may consider switching to dom0-provided kernel.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Linux binaries.

Summary
--------

On 2023-08-08, the Xen Project published XSA-432, "Linux: buffer
overrun in netback due to unusual packet" [4]:

| The fix for XSA-423 added logic to Linux'es netback driver to deal with
| a frontend splitting a packet in a way such that not all of the headers
| would come in one piece.  Unfortunately the logic introduced there
| didn't account for the extreme case of the entire packet being split
| into as many pieces as permitted by the protocol, yet still being
| smaller than the area that's specially dealt with to keep all (possible)
| headers together.  Such an unusual packet would therefore trigger a
| buffer overrun in the driver.
| 
| An unprivileged guest can cause Denial of Service (DoS) of the host by
| sending network packets to the backend, causing the backend to crash.
| 
| Data corruption or privilege escalation seem unlikely but have not been
| ruled out.


Impact
-------

A malicious qube might try to attack its network-providing qube
(usually sys-firewall). Such attack is unlikely to succeed, but if
that happens, it can observe and modify network traffic of other
qubes. Further impact depends on network traffic characteristics
(especially, if authenticated protocols like HTTPS are used).
