     Issues with PV domains and PCI passthrough (XSA-401, XSA-402)


User action required
---------------------

Users must install the following specific packages in order to address
the issues discussed in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.0, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.8.5-40

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.14.5-2

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [1] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [2]

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.


Summary
--------

The following security advisories were published on 2022-06-09:

XSA-401 [3] "x86 pv: Race condition in typeref acquisition":

| Xen maintains a type reference count for pages, in addition to a regular
| reference count.  This scheme is used to maintain invariants required
| for Xen's safety, e.g. PV guests may not have direct writeable access to
| pagetables; updates need auditing by Xen.
| 
| Unfortunately, the logic for acquiring a type reference has a race
| condition, whereby a safely TLB flush is issued too early and creates a
| window where the guest can re-establish the read/write mapping before
| writeability is prohibited.

XSA-402 [4] "x86 pv: Insufficient care with non-coherent mappings":

| Xen maintains a type reference count for pages, in addition to a regular
| reference count.  This scheme is used to maintain invariants required
| for Xen's safety, e.g. PV guests may not have direct writeable access to
| pagetables; updates need auditing by Xen.
| 
| Unfortunately, Xen's safety logic doesn't account for CPU-induced cache
| non-coherency; cases where the CPU can cause the content of the cache to
| be different to the content in main memory.  In such cases, Xen's safety
| logic can incorrectly conclude that the contents of a page is safe.


Impact
-------

Each of the issues allows a malicious PV domain that has PCI devices
assigned to escalate their privilege to control the whole host. In
default Qubes OS configuration, that affects only stubdomains for
sys-net and sys-usb. This means, the attacker first needs to exploit
a hypothetical vulnerability in QEMU to gain control over the
stubdomain.

The XSA-402 issue affects only AMD systems, and Intel systems before
IvyBridge (3rd generation of Intel Core processors). Newer Intel
systems are not affected.
