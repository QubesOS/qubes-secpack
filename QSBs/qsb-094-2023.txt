            x86/AMD: Divide speculative information leak

User action required
---------------------

Users must install the following specific packages in order to address
the issues discussed in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.14.6-2

  For Qubes 4.2, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.17.2-2

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.

Summary
--------

On 2023-09-25, the Xen Project published XSA-439, "x86/AMD: Divide
speculative information leak" [3]:

| In the Zen1 microarchitecure, there is one divider in the pipeline which
| services uops from both threads.  In the case of #DE, the latched result
| from the previous DIV to execute will be forwarded speculatively.
| 
| This is a covert channel that allows two threads to communicate without
| any system calls.  In also allows userspace to obtain the result of the
| most recent DIV instruction executed (even speculatively) in the core,
| which can be from a higher privilege context.
| 
| For more information, see:

Impact
-------

An attacker might be able to infer data from a different execution
context on the same CPU core. This includes data belonging to
different qube scheduled on the same CPU core before, or Xen itself
(which also may access data belonging to a different qube).
