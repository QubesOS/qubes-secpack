          Double unlock in x86 guest IRQ handling (XSA-458)

User action
------------

Continue to update normally [1] in order to receive the security updates
described in the "Patching" section below. No other user action is
required in response to this QSB.

Summary
--------

On 2024-07-16, the Xen Project published XSA-458, "double unlock in
x86 guest IRQ handling" [3]:
| An optional feature of PCI MSI called "Multiple Message" allows a
| device to use multiple consecutive interrupt vectors.  Unlike for MSI-X,
| the setting up of these consecutive vectors needs to happen all in one
| go.  In this handling an error path could be taken in different
| situations, with or without a particular lock held.  This error path
| wrongly releases the lock even when it is not currently held.


Impact
-------

A qube with PCI device with multi-vector MSI capability may be able to
compromise the whole host. In default Qubes OS configuration that
applies to sys-net and/or sys-usb.


Affected systems
-----------------

Both Qubes OS 4.1 and 4.2 versions are affected.

Only systems with multi-vector MSI capable PCI devices that are
assigned to some qube are vulnerable. Network cards with multi-vector
MSI are not common, but USB controllers with this capability are.

This can be checked using `lspci` utility on a specific device. For
example, to check USB controller assigned to sys-usb:

    $ qvm-pci ls sys-usb
    BACKEND:DEVID  DESCRIPTION                            USED BY
    dom0:00_14.0   USB controller: Intel Corporation ...  sys-usb (no-strict-reset=True)
    
Replace "_" with ":" in the DEVID field and use `lspci -vvs` on it:

    $ sudo lspci -vvs 00:14.0
    00:14.0 USB controller: Intel Corporation ...
    ...
        Capabilities: [80] MSI: Enable+ Count=1/8 Maskable- 64bit+
            Address: 00000000fee01078  Data: 0000

The important part is "MSI" capability line - `Count=1/8` means it
supports 8 vector, so it is a multi-vector capable device. If there is
`Count=1/1`, or no "MSI" capability at all, this device does not allow
performing the attack. Note the issue applies only to "MSI", and not
"MSI-X".


Patching
---------

The following packages contain security updates that address the
vulnerabilities described in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.14.6-10

  For Qubes 4.2, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.17.4-4

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [2] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [1]

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.
