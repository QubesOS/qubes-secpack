             Multiple speculative security issues (XSA-398)

Changelog
----------

2022-03-09: Original QSB published
2022-04-04: Updated package version for R4.1 to include complete fix


User action required
---------------------

Users must install the following specific packages in order to address
the issues discussed in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.0, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.8.5-38

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.14.4-3

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [1] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [2]

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.


Summary
--------

On 2022-03-08, the Xen Project published XSA-398, "Multiple
speculative security issues" [3]:

| 1) Researchers at VU Amsterdam have discovered Spectre-BHB, pertaining
|    to the use of Branch History between privilege levels.
| 
|    ARM have assigned CVE-2022-23960.  Intel have assigned CVE-2022-0001
|    (Branch History Injection) and CVE-2022-0002 (Intra-mode BTI).  AMD
|    have no statement at the time of writing.

|      https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00598.html
| 
| 2) Researchers at Open Source Security, Inc. have discovered that AMD
|    CPUs may speculate beyond direct branches.
| 
|    AMD have assigned CVE-2021-26341.

|      https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-1026
| 
| 3) Researchers at Intel have discovered that previous Spectre-v2
|    recommendations of using lfence/jmp is incomplete.
| 
|    AMD have assigned CVE-2021-26401.

Impact
-------

The Xen Project's summary above enumerates three security issues. The
first one, in practice, affects only newer Intel systems (11th
generation and later). For other systems, previous mitigations
are already sufficient. The second issue does not, in practice, affect
any configuration supported by Qubes OS. The third issue affects only
AMD systems.
On affected systems, an attacker might be able to infer the contents
of arbitrary host memory, including memory assigned to other guests.
