            "Reptar" Intel redundant prefix vulnerability
                   (CVE-2023-23583, INTEL-SA-00950)

User action
------------

Continue to update normally [1] in order to receive the security updates
described in the "Patching" section below. No other user action is
required in response to this QSB.

Summary
--------

On 2023-11-14, Intel published INTEL-SA-00950, "2023.4 IPU Out-of-Band
(OOB) - IntelÂ® Processor Advisory" [3] accompanied by advisory guidance
[4] that states:

| Under certain microarchitectural conditions, Intel has identified
| cases where execution of an instruction (REP MOVSB) encoded with a
| redundant REX prefix may result in unpredictable system behavior
| resulting in a system crash/hang, or, in some limited scenarios, may
| allow escalation of privilege (EoP) from CPL3 to CPL0.

This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2023-23583. [5]

Impact
-------

On affected systems, a qube running in PV mode can escalate its
privileges to that of dom0. Additionally, any qube can perform a
denial-of-service (DoS) attack against dom0, which may cause Qubes OS
to crash. In the default Qubes OS configuration, only the stubdomains
for HVMs are in a position to exploit this vulnerability in order to
attack other qubes. (Dom0 also runs in PV mode, but it is fully
trusted.)

Tavis Ormandy's write-up [6] suggests that disabling hyper-threading
(which Qubes OS does by default) might reduce the impact to that of a
denial-of-service attack, but we cannot completely rule out possibility
of privilege escalation even with hyper-threading disabled.

Affected systems
-----------------

Only systems with Intel processors are affected, specifically:

- 10th generation Core and newer processors
- Certain server processors

According to Intel, some recent processor families already have
mitigations. For details, see the tables of affected products in
INTEL-SA-00950. [3]

Patching
---------

The following packages contain security updates that address the
vulnerabilities described in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0:
  - microcode_ctl, version 2.1-56.qubes1

  For Qubes 4.2, in dom0:
  - microcode_ctl, version 2.1-56.qubes1

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [2] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [1]

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
initramfs binaries.
