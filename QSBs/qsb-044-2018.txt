           Multiple Xen vulnerabilities (XSA-275, XSA-280)

Summary
========

On 2018-11-20, the Xen Security Team published multiple Xen Security
Advisories (XSAs):

XSA-275 [1] "insufficient TLB flushing / improper large page mappings
with AMD IOMMUs":
| In order to be certain that no undue access to memory is possible
| anymore after IOMMU mappings of this memory have been removed,
| Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs) need to be flushed after most
| changes to such mappings.  Xen bypassed certain IOMMU flushes on AMD
| x86 hardware.
| 
| Furthermore logic exists Xen to re-combine small page mappings
| into larger ones.  Such re-combination could have occured in cases
| when it was not really safe/correct to do so.
| 
| A malicious or buggy guest may be able to escalate its privileges, may
| cause a Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host, or may be
| able to access data it is not supposed to access (information leak).

XSA-275 affects only AMD CPUs using IOMMU on both Qubes OS 3.2 and Qubes
OS 4.0. XSA-275 does not affect Intel CPUs on any Qubes OS version.

XSA-280 [2] "Fix for XSA-240 conflicts with shadow paging":
| The fix for XSA-240 introduced a new field into the control structure
| associated with each page of RAM.  This field was added to a union,
| another member of which is used when Xen uses shadow paging for the
| guest.  During migration, or with the L1TF (XSA-273) mitigation for
| PV guests in effect, the two uses conflict.
| 
| A malicious or buggy x86 PV guest may cause Xen to crash, resulting in
| a DoS (Denial of Service) affecting the entire host.  Privilege
| escalation as well as information leaks cannot be ruled out.

XSA-280 affects only Qubes OS 3.2. XSA-280 does not affect Qubes OS 4.0,
since the shadow paging feature is disabled at build time for 4.0.

Patching
=========

The specific packages that resolve the problems discussed in this
bulletin are as follows:

  For Qubes OS 3.2:
  - Xen packages, version 4.6.6-45

  For Qubes OS 4.0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.8.4-7

The packages are to be installed in dom0 via the Qubes VM Manager or via
the qubes-dom0-update command as follows:

  For updates from the stable repository (not immediately available):
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update

  For updates from the security-testing repository:
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-dom0-security-testing

A system restart will be required afterwards.

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.
