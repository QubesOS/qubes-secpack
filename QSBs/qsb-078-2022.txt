       Linux kernel PV driver issues and LVM misconfiguration


User action required
---------------------

Users must install the following specific packages in order to address
the issues discussed in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.0, in dom0:
  - Kernel packages, versions 5.4.183-2, 5.16.13-2, 4.19.233-2
  - LVM2 packages, version 2.02.167-4

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0:
  - Kernel packages, versions 5.10.104-2, 5.16.13-2
  - LVM2 packages, version 2.03.09-2

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [1] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [2]

A system restart is required in order for the updates to take effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Dom0 kernel binaries.

By default, qube kernels are provided by dom0. However, advanced users
may instead opt to install a different kernel inside of a qube, e.g.,
from an upstream distribution like Fedora or Debian. [3] Such users
should consult that distribution's update channels for any kernel
updates that might be relevant to this bulletin.

In addition, advanced users with customized setups are advised that the
LVM patch changes the LVM's default value for "global_filter" [5]. This
means you must ensure that the device that contains the LVM with Qubes'
rootfs is allowed, or else your system will not boot.


Summary
--------

On 2022-03-10, the Xen project published XSA-396, "Linux PV device
frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends" [4]:

| Several Linux PV device frontends are using the grant table interfaces
| for removing access rights of the backends in ways being subject to
| race conditions, resulting in potential data leaks, data corruption
| by malicious backends, and denial of service triggered by malicious
| backends:
| 
| blkfront, netfront, scsifront and the gntalloc driver are testing
| whether a grant reference is still in use. If this is not the case,
| they assume that a following removal of the granted access will always
| succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the granted
| page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep
| access to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be
| used after the frontend I/O has finished. The xenbus driver has a
| similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the
| granted access of a shared ring buffer.
| blkfront: CVE-2022-23036
| netfront: CVE-2022-23037
| scsifront: CVE-2022-23038
| gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039
| xenbus: CVE-2022-23040
| 
| blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus, 9p, kbdfront,
| and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant
| reference until it is no longer in use, but the freeing of the related
| data page is not synchronized with dropping the granted access. As a
| result the backend can keep access to the memory page even after it
| has been freed and then re-used for a different purpose.
| CVE-2022-23041
| 
| 
| netfront will fail a BUG_ON() assertion if it fails to revoke access
| in the rx path. This will result in a Denial of Service (DoS)
| situation of the guest which can be triggered by the backend.
| CVE-2022-23042

As a separate matter, there is a misconfiguration in the Linux Volume
Manager (LVM) in dom0 that affects certain custom storage configurations
(see below). In affected systems, the LVM fails to ignore devices that
are controlled by other qubes. This exposes the LVM metadata parser in
dom0 to untrusted data, which could, hypothetically, be exploited in
combination with an another vulnerability and which may result in the
LVM becoming "confused" about which devices it should use.


Impact
-------

Regarding XSA-396, due to race conditions and missing tests of return
codes in the Linux PV device frontend drivers, a malicious backend could
gain access (both read and write) to memory pages to which it should not
have such access, or it could directly trigger a denial of service (DoS)
in the qube in which it is running. A backend gaining full control over
its frontend qube is unlikely but cannot be ruled out. In the default
Qubes OS configuration, this allows malicious sys-net, sys-firewall, and
sys-usb qubes to attack any qube to which they are connected (either as
network provider or as a block-device provider via `qvm-block`). XSA-396
does not affect qubes that are not connected to any network and that do
not have any extra disks attached.

The LVM misconfiguration affects only systems that (a) use both an LVM
storage pool and another non-LVM storage pool or (b) enable the
"ephemeral" volume property (available in R4.1). The default Qubes OS
configuration is not affected. In affected systems, a malicious qube
that controls a non-LVM, writable storage volume may "confuse" the LVM
in dom0 about which storage devices should be used. This may prevent
many management actions on qubes from being performed, including
creating, removing, starting, and resizing. If such a malicious qube
knows dom0's volume group UUID, it could also imitate the disks of other
qubes, but it cannot directly extract their original content).
Extracting the volume group UUID itself is not possible by exploiting
this misconfiguration. Finally, since this misconfiguration results in
the LVM metadata parser in dom0 being exposed to untrusted data, it's
possible that it could be chained with another attack.
