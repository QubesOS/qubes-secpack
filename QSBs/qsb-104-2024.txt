                      GUI-related security bugs

User action
------------

Continue to update normally [1] in order to receive the security updates
described in the "Patching" section below. No other user action is
required in response to this QSB.

Summary
--------

This QSB concerns two separate GUI-related bugs with potential security
implications:

1. If the keyboard auto-repeat feature is enabled both in dom0 and in an
   app qube, and the user attempts to select either the "Copy to other
   qube..." or "Move to other qube..." context menu option on a file in
   that app qube's graphical file manager using the Enter key (rather
   than clicking on it with the mouse cursor), the keyboard auto-repeat
   feature can cause the selected file to be opened in the source qube.

2. The Xfce taskbar in dom0 incorrectly handles application icons, which
   can result in some application icons being the wrong color.

Impact
-------

The impact of the first bug depends on the user's habits. If the user
intends to copy a file to another qube before opening it, this bug could
result in that file being opened in the wrong qube, potentially
compromising it. For example, if the user receives a file via email,
saves it in the email qube, then attempts to copy it to another qube,
this bug could result in the file being opened in the email qube.

An attacker who manages to compromise a qube or an application running
inside of a qube could attempt to exploit the second bug in order to
make an application icon from that qube appear in dom0's Xfce taskbar
with a color different from that qube's true color label. For example,
an attacker who controls an application in a qube with the yellow color
label could cause that application's icon to have the color green in the
taskbar in an attempt to deceive or confuse the user. This bug affects
only application icon colors in dom0's Xfce taskbar. It does not affect
other window decorations (i.e., window borders, title bars, or icons in
title bars), nor does it affect icons that appear when switching between
windows with Alt + Tab.

Affected systems
-----------------

The first bug affects both Qubes OS 4.1 and Qubes OS 4.2.

The second bug affects only Qubes OS 4.2 when using the Xfce desktop
environment, which is the default desktop environment.

Discussion
-----------

The first bug can occur if, and only if, the keyboard auto-repeat
feature is enabled in both dom0 and an app qube. By design, app qubes do
not "see" all keyboard events. Instead, they see only the keyboard
events that are sent when a window belonging to that qube is in focus.
Therefore, if focus switches from one qube's window to another's while a
key is being pressed, it may appear to the former qube that the key was
pressed for much longer than it actually was. In particular, the former
qube may "believe" that the key is being pressed until a window
belonging to that qube regains focus and the key is released.
Consequently, the auto-repeat feature generates far more events than it
should.

In this particular case, when the user selects either the "Copy to other
qube..." or "Move to other qube..." option, focus switches to the qrexec
prompt in dom0, and the Enter key may appear to the app qube to be
pressed the whole time while the user interacts with the qrexec prompt.
Due to the auto-repeat feature, this may generate further "key press"
events that are later interpreted by the file manager as requests to
open the file normally.

What should happen instead is that the qube should see just one "key
press" event and (possibly much later) one "key release" event, and this
is exactly what happens when the auto-repeat feature is disabled in the
qube. (Note: One might consider sending a synthetic "key release" event
for any key that is still being pressed when an application loses focus,
but that would cause extra key presses to be delivered when the
application regains focus.)

The second bug is caused by the libwnck3 library (which is used by
Xfce's "Window Buttons" widget) interpreting icons incorrectly. Each
window icon is stored in a `_NET_WM_ICON` window property in an ARGB
format. The upstream version of the library correctly converts this ARGB
format into RGBA, then loads it into a `GdkPixbuf` object, which is
later used by the taskbar. However, the Fedora package has extra patches
that add support for HiDPI scaling, which changes `GdkPixbuf` to
`cairo_surface_t`. The latter has native support for the
`CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32` format, so the manual conversion was removed.

The problem is that `ARGB` and `CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32` have subtle
differences related to transparency. The latter assumes that color
channels are pre-multiplied by the alpha channel, [3] but this isn't the
case in `ARGB`. An attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability
in order to manipulate color channels after the icon has been colored in
accordance with the qube's color label, completely changing the icon's
color in some cases. Specifically, by adjusting the alpha channel, it
may be possible to wrap high color values into low ones. For example, a
pixel with the values R=255, G=250, B=0, and A=254 should appear as
yellow. However, due to the pre-multiplied format, the alpha channel
determines the valid range for color channels. In this case, setting
A=254 results in a valid range of 0-254 for the R, G, and B color
channels. Since R=255 is outside of this range, the red channel would
wrap to zero, resulting in a green pixel. This bug has been present in
Fedora's libwnck3 package since Fedora 34. [4]

Patching
---------

The following packages contain security updates that address the
vulnerabilities described in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.1, in templates:
  - qubes-gui-agent version TODO

  For Qubes 4.2, in dom0 and templates:
  - qubes-gui-agent version TODO (all templates)
  - libwnck3 version TODO (Fedora templates and dom0)

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [2] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [1]

User session and all qubes must be restarted afterward in order for
the updates to take effect.
