     Critical Xen bug in PV memory virtualization code (XSA 148)


Quick Summary
==============

The Xen Security Team has announced a critical security bug (XSA 148)
in the hypervisor code handling memory virtualization for the PV VMs
[1]:

| The code to validate level 2 page table entries is bypassed when
| certain conditions are satisfied.  This means that a PV guest can
| create writeable mappings using super page mappings.
| 
| Such writeable mappings can violate Xen intended invariants for pages
| which Xen is supposed to keep read-only.

The above is a political way of stating the bug is a very critical
one. Probably the worst we have seen affecting the Xen hypervisor,
ever. Sadly.

Description of the Bug
=======================

The bug is in the mod_l2_entry() function which handles requests from
the PV guests to update their page table mappings:

    /* Update the L2 entry at pl2e to new value nl2e. pl2e is within frame pfn. */
    static int mod_l2_entry(l2_pgentry_t *pl2e, 
                            l2_pgentry_t nl2e, 
                            unsigned long pfn,
                            int preserve_ad,
                            struct vcpu *vcpu)
    {
        l2_pgentry_t ol2e;
        struct domain *d = vcpu->domain;
        struct page_info *l2pg = mfn_to_page(pfn);
        unsigned long type = l2pg->u.inuse.type_info;
        int rc = 0;
    
        if ( unlikely(!is_guest_l2_slot(d, type, pgentry_ptr_to_slot(pl2e))) )
        {
            //...
        }
    
        if ( unlikely(__copy_from_user(&ol2e, pl2e, sizeof(ol2e)) != 0) )
            return -EFAULT;
    
        if ( l2e_get_flags(nl2e) & _PAGE_PRESENT )
        {
            if ( unlikely(l2e_get_flags(nl2e) & L2_DISALLOW_MASK) )
            {
                //...
            }
    
            /* Fast path for identical mapping and presence. */
            if ( !l2e_has_changed(ol2e, nl2e, _PAGE_PRESENT) )
            {
                adjust_guest_l2e(nl2e, d);
                if ( UPDATE_ENTRY(l2, pl2e, ol2e, nl2e, pfn, vcpu, preserve_ad) )
                    return 0;
                return -EBUSY;
            }

The above code becomes buggy only if we also look at the definition of
the L2_DISALLOW_MASK macro:

    #define L2_DISALLOW_MASK (base_disallow_mask & ~_PAGE_PSE)

and also how the base_disallow_mask gets initialized:

void __init arch_init_memory(void)
{
    (...)
    /* Basic guest-accessible flags: PRESENT, R/W, USER, A/D, AVAIL[0,1,2] */
    base_disallow_mask = ~(_PAGE_PRESENT|_PAGE_RW|_PAGE_USER|
                           _PAGE_ACCESSED|_PAGE_DIRTY|_PAGE_AVAIL);
 

We see the attacker might request setting of the (PSE | RW) bits in
the L2 PDE (which is possible thanks to L2_DISALLOW_MASK not excluding
the PSE bit, something which has been added to support the superpage
mappings for the PV guests), thus making the whole L1 table accessible
to the guest with R/W rights (now seen as a large 2MB page), and
modify one or more of the PTEs there to point to an arbitrary MFN the
attacker feels like having access to.

Now that would not be all fatal, if the attacker had no way of
tricking Xen into treating this (now under the attacker's control)
super-page back as a valid table of PTEs. Sadly, there is nothing to
stop her from doing that. Thus we end up with Xen now treating the
attacker-filled memory as a set of valid PTEs for the (PV) guest. This
means the guest, by referencing the addresses mapped by these pages,
is now really accessing whatever MFNs the attacker decided to write
into the PTEs. In other words, the guest can access now all the
system's memory. Reliably.

The attack works irrespectively of whether the opt_allow_superpage is
true or not.

The bug has been introduced a while ago, so to say, when the support
for superpages has been added [2].


Additional thoughts by the Qubes Security Team
===============================================

Admittedly this is subtle bug, because there is no immediately buggy
code that could be spotted immediately. The bug emerges only if one
looks at a bigger picture of logic flows (compare also QSB #09 for a
somehow similar situation).

On the other hand, it is really shocking that such a bug has been
lurking in such a core element of the hypervisor for so many years. In
our opinion the Xen project should rethink their coding guidelines and
try to come up with practices and perhaps additional mechanisms that
would not let similar flaws to plague the hypervisor ever again
(assert-like mechanisms perhaps?). Otherwise the whole project makes
no sense, at least to those who would like to use Xen for
security-sensitive work. Sadly.

Specifically, it worries us that, in the last 7 years (i.e. all the
time when the bug was sitting there having a good time) so much
engineering and development effort has been put into adding all sorts
of new features and whatnots, yet no serious effort to improve Xen
security effectively. Because, of course, there have been many more
security bugs found in Xen over the last years (as the numbering of
this XSA suggests). True, majority of these didn't affect Qubes OS,
sometimes by pure luck, sometimes because of the extra prudence we
took, many other times because of the architectural decisions we made.
Nevertheless, the bugs in Xen are being found regularly, and this is
no good news.  For a type I hypervisor of the age and maturity of Xen,
this simply should not be happening. If it does, it suggests the
development process is not prioritizing security.

This bug might also be considered an argument for the view of ditching
of para-virtualized (PV) VMs, and switch to HVMs, or better yet: PVH
VMs for better isolation. This seems to be a valid argument indeed,
but only if the underlying processor also supports SLAT (e.g. EPT), we
believe. Otherwise the complexity of the hypervisor code needed to
implement Shadow Paging offsets any potential benefits of using
CPU-assisted virtualization, such as VT-x. Luckily it seems majority
of the recent modern laptops does support SLAT, so this might be the
direction we go for Qubes 4.

Patching
=========

Exceptionally, given the significance of the bug, we decided to upload
the patched packages directly to the current repository, omitting the
usual 1-week period of having the packages lay in the security-testing
repository.

The specific packages that resolve the problem discussed in this
bulletin have been uploaded to the current repository:

* TODO

The packages are to be installed in Dom0 via qubes-dom0-update command
or via the Qubes graphical manager.

TODO: mention additional Xen packages for other patches?

Credits
========

This bugs has been made available to us by Xen Security Team via the
Xen pre-discourse list.
