Retbleed - arbitrary speculative code execution with return instructions (XSA-407)


User action required
---------------------

Users must install the following specific packages in order to address
the issues discussed in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.0, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.8.5-43

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.14.5-6

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [1] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [2]

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.


Summary
--------

On 2022-07-12, the Xen Project published XSA-407, "Retbleed -
arbitrary speculative code execution with return instructions" [3]:

| Researchers at ETH Zurich have discovered Retbleed, allowing for
| arbitrary speculative execution in a victim context.
| 
| For more details, see:
|   https://comsec.ethz.ch/retbleed
| 
| ETH Zurich have allocated CVE-2022-29900 for AMD and CVE-2022-29901 for
| Intel.
| 
| Despite the similar preconditions, these are very different
| microarchitectural behaviours between vendors.
| 
| On AMD CPUs, Retbleed is one specific instance of a more general
| microarchitectural behaviour called Branch Type Confusion.  AMD have
| assigned CVE-2022-23816 (Retbleed) and CVE-2022-23825 (Branch Type
| Confusion).
| 
| For more details, see:
|   https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-1037
| 
| On Intel CPUs, Retbleed is not a new vulnerability; it is only
| applicable to software which did not follow Intel's original Spectre-v2
| guidance.  Intel are using the ETH Zurich allocated CVE-2022-29901.
| 
| For more details, see:
|   https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00702.html
|   https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/return-stack-buffer-underflow.html
| 
| ARM have indicated existing guidance on Spectre-v2 is sufficient.


Impact
-------

This is yet another speculative execution issue, which allows an
attacker to infer content of memory they shouldn't have access to.
This includes one VM extracting secrets from another. Any VM can
perform this attack on an affected hardware.

AMD systems based on Zen1 - Zen2 microarchitectures are affected.
Specifically those are AMD Ryzen processors with model names 1xxx -
4xxx. Zen3 microarchitecture (AMD Ryzen 5xxx or newer) are not
affected.
Pre-existing Xen mitigations on Intel machines are effective to
prevent this issue, so Intel systems are not affected.
