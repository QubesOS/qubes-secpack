Qubes Clipboard Timing Attacks and Qubes Core Python API Inconsistency


Quick Summary
==============

This Security Bulletin discusses two (unrelated) security problems
potentially affecting Qubes OS. One problem might allow for stealing
or injecting Qubes clipboard, while another to construct a multistage
attack on Dom0. We believe both of these attacks are largely
theoretical, but recommend patching nevertheless (see the end of this
document for patching instructions).


Timing Attacks on Qubes Secure Clipboard
=========================================

Problem description
--------------------

Jann Horn has discovered two smart attacks in which a malicious AppVM
might, under some circumstances and with some cooperation of the
physical user, attack the Qubes Secure Clipboard mechanism, by either
stealing or providing a falsified contents without the user realizing
it.

In the first attack scenario (clipboard injection attack), the
malicious AppVM, which the physical user has selected for copy-from
operation (i.e. the user selected one of its windows and pressed the
Qubes unspoofable clipboard copy key combination, typically
Ctrl-Shift-C), delays its response (which contain the contents of the
clipboard) for an extended period of time, hoping the user might
select another AppVM and issue another copy-from clipboard operation
in the meantime. If the attacker guesses the timing correctly and now
completes the response after the 2nd AppVM responded with its
clipboard contents, the Qubes GUI daemon serving the 1st (malicious)
AppVM will now overwrite the Qubes global clipboard with the data
provided by the 1st (malicious) AppVM. If the 2nd AppVM was considered
trusted and the clipboard copied from this 2nd AppVM was supposed to
be used as sensitive input into some other AppVM (e.g. it might have
been a shell command), this would present a security problem.


However, given the attacker in the malicious AppVM is unable to
observe any events outside of the AppVM, nor is able to influence the
physical user actions, we consider this attack highly theoretical.

In the second attack (clipboard stealing attack), the malicious AppVM
attempts to block the corresponding GUI daemon just a moment before
the user is likely to issue Qubes global clipboard paste-to operation.
The AppVM can pretty reliably guess this moment by looking for
scancodes of the 'Ctrl' and 'Shift' keys, which would be normally
provided to it via the GUI daemon before the user presses the 'V' key
which completes the magic Qubes clipboard paste sequence (Qubes allows
to redefine this sequence, but we assume here the default is used, for
simplicity of description). Once the attacking AppVM detects the
Ctrl-Shit sequence, it might start blocking its corresponding GUI
daemon, e.g. by sending a partial message over the vchan connection.
This will, naturally, cause all the GUI windows of this AppVM to
freeze on Dom0 desktop. Now, if the user, unperplexed by this sudden
freeze of all the AppVM's windows, will continue to work with other
AppVMs, and at some point decides to copy some sensitive data to Qubes
global clipboard from another AppVM, then it might be possible for the
attacking AppVM to steal it. This is because the attacking AppVM could
now: 1) unblock its GUI daemon (hanging so far), which would 2) cause
it to consume the Ctrl-Shift-V event queued a while ago by the Dom0 X
server (it's important to realize that Qubes GUI daemon processes both
the Dom0 X events and GUI protocol messages in the same thread,
alternating between the two queues), and this will lead it to 3) send
the _current_ (not the one the user intended a while back, when
originally pressed the Ctrl-Shift-V combination) content of the global
clipboard to that AppVM.


Discussion of practical impact
-------------------------------

Both of the attacks discussed above require precise timing, which we
believe presents a very hard challange for the attacker who is unable
to observe any relevant events in the system outside of the attacker's
AppVM, e.g. that the physical user just copied some (sensitive) buffer
to the global clipboard from another AppVM, neither is able to
influence the physical user behaviour, e.g. force it to copy something
the attacker is after (from another AppVM) into the global clipboard.

In both of the attack scenario the attacker must fit in a (typically)
very shallow timing window between when the user copies and pastes the
buffer between some other two AppVMs (this constrain applies also to
the 2nd attack because Qubes automatically wipes the global clipboard
content after a paste operation).

Additional complication for the 1st attack (clipboard injection) is
that the attacker has typically no way of knowing what application the
user intends to paste the buffer to, nor its state.

Additional complication for the 2nd attack (clipboard stealing) is
freezing of all the AppVMs windows for the whole period while the
attacker is waiting for the user to issue copy operation to the global
clipboard in another AppVM.

Jann Horn suggested a theoretical improvement for the stealing attack,
where the attacking AppVM generates lots of window resize events (over
Qubes GUI protocol), which in turn generate lots of X events in Dom0
that are send to the GUI daemon (to its X events queue). This allows
the GUI agent (in the attacking AppVM) to periodically complete the
vchan message, forcing the GUI daemon to refresh the windows contents.
Unfortunately we have had no success testing this improved attack in
practice. Additionally, even if the attacker could use this trick for
sucessful refreshing of the window contents, they would still not be
able to correctly handle mouse or keyboard input to the VM. And, last
but not least, the primary problem for the attacker, i.e. timing,
remains still the major blocker for this stealing attack.


Solution
---------

Both of the attacks are a result of subtle race condition in managing
of the Qubes global clipboard. We believe we have now resolved this
issue by 1) keeping track of when the global clipboard file was last
modified (by a successful fetch-from-VM operation), and 2) when the
particular GUI daemon received clipboard copy magic sequence
(Ctrl-Shift-C).

If we detect that the timestampt of the (latest) clipboard copy magic
keypress is *before* the time of last effective modification of the
Qubes global clipboard, we drop that request and don't overwrite the
clipboard, thus eliminating the 1st attack.

Similarly, if we detect the timestampt of the magic clipboard paste
event (as provided to the gui daemon by the Dom0 X event) is *before*
the time of last effective modification of the Qubes global clipboard,
we drop that request, eliminating the 2nd attack.

The above fix has been committed to the gui-daemon repository [1].


Qubes Core API inconsistency in QubesVm.run() method
================================================

Problem description
--------------------

An individual nicknamed HW42 pointed out a semantic problem with one
of the functions compromising Qubes Core API that might result in
security vulnerabilities in programs using this API incorrectly.

The problematic API turned out to be the interpretation of the 'wait'
and 'passio' arguments in the QubesVm.run() method. Contrary to what a
programmer might expect, passing 'passio = False' was itself not
enough to prevent QubesVm.run() from connecting the VM's process
output (i.e.  stdin/stdout) to the calling process. In fact this was
only the case if additionally 'wait = False' was also passed to the
run() method.  Fortunately both of these parameters were defined as
False by default.

However, if a program called this method in the following way:

some_untrusted_vm.run (..., passio = False, wait = True)

This would result in the run() method connecting stdout of the
(untrusted) process in the VM to the (trusted) calling process,
despite the, admittedly obvious, programmer's intention not to. This
might then resulted in unexpected consequences, depending on how was
the output handled.

In fact, HW42 pointed out that one of the Qubes internal commands,
qvm-sync-clock (itself called by qubes-dom0-update command), did
indeed call the run() method in the above way, making it vulnerable to
outputting un-escaped sequences in case one of the agent processes in
one of the (untrusted) VMs got compromised by an attacker.

We have not identified any more programs calling the run() method in
this way. However it cannot be ruled out that custom programs doing
that exist. These should then be carefully reviewed, specifically what
other programs consume and process their stdout.

Discussion of practical impact
--------------------------------

For the default Qubes installation the practical impact is limited to
feeding the Dom0 terminal with (untrusted) escape sequence codes [2].
The problem of exposing terminals to such untrusted escape sequences
has been known for more than a decade, as seen in the referenced
paper, and it looks like all the popular terminal emulators are immune
to such attacks these days. Specifically we have tested the terminal
emulators that ship with Qubes Dom0, i.e. Konsole and Gnome Terminal,
and concluded they are safe from these attacks. Nevertheless it's
advisable to patch this problem.


Solution
---------

To address this issue, we have modified QubesVm.run() behavior to
reflect what a common sense tells, i.e. to discard any output from
remote process whenever passio is False [3].

Patching
=========

The specific packages that resolve the problems mentioned in this
bulletin have been uploaded to the current-testing repo:

* qubes-gui-dom0 version 2.1.35
* qubes-core-dom0 version 2.1.66

The packages are to be installed in Dom0 via qubes-dom0-update command
or via the Qubes graphical manager. After instillation it is necessary
to restart each of the VMs for changes to take effect (for the
clipboard issue). Reboot of the whole system is not necessary.
