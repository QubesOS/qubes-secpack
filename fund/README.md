This directory contains the official cryptocurrency donation addresses for the
Qubes OS Project.

In order to allow for the authenticity and integrity of these donation addresses
to be verified, each address file is PGP-signed in two ways. First, each file is
accompanied by detached PGP signatures from members of the Qubes Security Team.
Second, each file is delivered via the Qubes Security Pack (qubes-secpack),
which is a Git repository. The latest commit in this repository should always
have a PGP-signed tag from a member of the Qubes Security Team. We strongly
recommend verifying the authenticity and integrity of these files prior to
making any donations to the addresses they contain.
