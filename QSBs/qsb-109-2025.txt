                       Intel microcode updates

User action
------------

Continue to update normally [1] in order to receive the security updates
described in the "Patching" section below. No other user action is
required in response to this QSB.

Summary
--------

On 2025-08-12, Intel published microcode updates [3] and accompanying
security advisories:

 - INTEL-SA-01249 [4]
 - INTEL-SA-01308 [5]
 - INTEL-SA-01310 [6]
 - INTEL-SA-01311 [7]
 - INTEL-SA-01313 [8]
 - INTEL-SA-01367 [9]

Unfortunately there's only very little information available. Based on
the limited description of the fixed vulnerabilities, INTEL-SA-01249 and
INTEL-SA-01308 (and less likely INTEL-SA-01310) might affect Qubes OS.

Impact
-------

On affected systems a qube might be able to escalate its privileges to
that of dom0/Xen.

Affected systems
-----------------

INTEL-SA-01249 affects 12th Generation Intel Core and newer CPUs, see
[4] for a more complete and detailed list. Note that for some CPUs the
fix was already part of the microcode updates released 2025-05-12, see
note in [3].

INTEL-SA-01308 and INTEL-SA-01310 affect only some Intel server CPUs,
see [5] and [6] for a list.

Patching
---------

The following packages contain security updates that address the
vulnerabilities described in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.2 and 4.3, in dom0:
  - microcode_ctl version 2.1.20250812

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [2] Once available, the packages should be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [1]

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
microcode updates.
