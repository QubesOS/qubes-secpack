system when notified. [1]

Patching
=========

The specific packages that address the issues discussed in this bulletin
are as follows:

TODO:
  For Qubes 4.0, in dom0:
  - TODO

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0:
  - TODO

The packages are to be installed in dom0 via the Qube Manager or via
the qubes-dom0-update command as follows:

  For updates from the stable repository (not immediately available):
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update

  For updates from the security-testing repository:
  $ sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-dom0-security-testing

The Qubes update system will notify you if a system restart is required
afterwards.

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [2]

TODO:
If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.
