           Speculative security issues on AMD CPUs (XSA-422)


User action required
---------------------

Users must install the following specific packages in order to address
the issues discussed in this bulletin:

  For Qubes 4.1, in dom0:
  - Xen packages, version 4.14.5-13

These packages will migrate from the security-testing repository to the
current (stable) repository over the next two weeks after being tested
by the community. [1] Once available, the packages are to be installed
via the Qubes Update tool or its command-line equivalents. [2]

Dom0 must be restarted afterward in order for the updates to take
effect.

If you use Anti Evil Maid, you will need to reseal your secret
passphrase to new PCR values, as PCR18+19 will change due to the new
Xen binaries.


Summary
--------

On 2022-11-08, the Xen Project published XSA-422, "x86: Multiple
speculative security issues" [3]:

| 1) Researchers have discovered that on some AMD CPUs, the
|    implementation of IBPB (Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier) does
|    not behave according to the specification.
|
|    Specifically, IBPB fails to properly flush the RAS (Return Address
|    Stack, also RSB - Return Stack Buffer - in Intel terminology; one
|    of the hardware prediction structures), allowing attacker
|    controlled values to survive across a deliberate attempt to purge
|    said values.
|
|    AMD have allocated CVE-2022-23824.

(Issue 2 described in that XSA is belived to not affect Xen and
therefore not relevant for Qubes)


Impact
-------

On affected CPUs a VM running in PV mode might be able to infer the
content of memory belonging to another running VM (including dom0). In
the default configuration only the stubdomains for HVM VMs are in a
position to attack other VMs (dom0 also runs in PV mode but it's fully
trusted).

Only some AMD CPUs are affected, see AMDs advisory [4] for a list.

(The XSA lists Xen versions less than 4.16 as unaffected, but Qubes has
backported a performance optimization [5] that assumes that IBPB works
as previously specified and is therefore affected)
